![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/VAO.png)

A series of demos to show how to create a VertexArrayObject from different types of data. There are examples of how to create a simple boid shape as I was getting fed up of flocking teapots!

There is a webgl demo of the sphere program [here](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/WebGL/VAO1/)
